# Smart Irrigation Arduino

Arduino-based Smart Irrigation System designed for campus green areas.  
The system monitors soil moisture and controls irrigation automatically.  
It logs data locally and produces CSV files suitable for machine learning applications.

---

## Features

- Automatic irrigation based on soil moisture levels  
- Real-time monitoring with sensor data  
- Local data logging to CSV format for further analysis  
- Easy integration with machine learning workflows  
- Simple and cost-effective hardware setup  

---

## Hardware Components

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- Soil moisture sensor (e.g., YL-69)  
- Relay module for controlling water pump/valve  
- Water pump or solenoid valve  
- Power supply  
- Connecting wires and breadboard  

---

## Installation and Usage

1. Connect the hardware components as per the wiring diagram.  
2. Upload the `SmartIrrigation.ino` sketch to your Arduino using Arduino IDE.  
3. The system will monitor soil moisture and activate irrigation when needed.  
4. Data will be logged locally on an SD card (if applicable) in CSV format for analysis.

## Data Output

- Logs soil moisture readings and irrigation events  
- CSV format compatible with Python, R, or other ML tools

## Future Improvements

- Add Wi-Fi module for remote monitoring and control  
- Implement advanced machine learning models to optimize irrigation schedules  
- Develop a mobile/web app dashboard for real-time status
